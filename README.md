# ApiCallVanillaJs

Same functionality as ApiCallWebCompnent or ApiCallReact, only without any helper libraries, just plain vanilla Javascript

No build process, no npm commands, just open up the index.html in a browser as a file. 

Should function the same as the other two pages - except without the CSS to make it look prettier.
